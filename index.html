            attending university at the University of California, Irvine, she has never strayed too far from her home.

            a pharmacy related setting, but when it was time to head to pharmacy school, she decliend and experienced what
            some would call a quarter-life crisis.

            For the past three years, Jannah has worked as a Native English Teacher and Lecturer in 
            Seoul, South Korea and Tokyo, Japan. Her time in these big cities has opened her eyes to the importance
            of web and app development and how it is incorporated into the everyday lives of people acround the world.

            learn more about the coding world.
            When she's not trying out new food places or sleeping, catch her on some hikes or at the movies.
